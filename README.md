# connectN

Using C programming, connectN allows you to play the popular game Connect-Four with any number you want. You can set the number of pieces needed to win at the beginning and the program will set up a game with that parameter. connectN allows two people to play against each other, and visual representations in the C console will show up after every turn to ensure you're not lost.
